There are different computer languages for comparing two strings as anagrams or not (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram).
The current version will support c++ and java. 

An old and simple discriminant analysis is implemented by python. 

Note that all codes (c++) are mainly used to show how to design programs, rather than simply solving a task.
